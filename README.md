### using

press ctrl-alt-s to format file,
press ctrl-enter to run

you need a `return` to actually get a value from your program

ctrl-s, ctrl-o, and ctrl-shift-s do as expected

### building

1. install nodejs
2. `npm i -g typescript`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm build`
5. `npm make`
6. look in `out/`
